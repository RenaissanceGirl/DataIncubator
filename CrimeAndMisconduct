###Police misconducts and crimes are not happening at the same places much. This is not necessarly a bad thing
#because having two models to predict locations of crime and police misconduct can cover more areas 
#in predicting where disturbances are likely to happen.

###crimes peak at midnight - 1am and also happens a lot from late afternoon to late evening
